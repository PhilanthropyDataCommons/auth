Apache Software License 2.0 (see LICENSE file).

The license choice is based on the license of the original work by Niko KÃ¶bler at https://github.com/dasniko/keycloak-extensions-demo. This module started with that code and re-uses it, so it is a combined work. To respect the original authors' choice of a free software license, avoid license confusion, and allow improvements in this repository to be used upstream, we keep the original license.
